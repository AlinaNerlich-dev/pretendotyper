# SleepyBud

The SleepyBud is a revolutionary sleep monitoring and soothing system for babies. It consists of a soft, breathable onesie embedded with eco-friendly sensors that track your baby's sleep patterns, body temperature, and movements.

The onesie is wirelessly connected to a compact, energy-efficient hub that uses advanced algorithms to analyze the data and respond accordingly. If the baby seems restless or uncomfortable, the hub can activate gentle vibrations, soothing sounds, or calming light patterns to help them drift back to sleep.

The SleepyBud system is designed to grow with your child, adapting its soothing techniques as they age. It also connects to a secure app, allowing you to monitor your baby's sleep from anywhere and receive personalized insights and tips from certified sleep experts.

Made from sustainable materials and powered by a rechargeable battery, the SleepyBud is an eco-friendly solution for promoting healthy sleep habits and reducing parental stress.
