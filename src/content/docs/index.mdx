## About the project

A groundbreaking web app for futuristic baby products has been developed using advanced AI models for text, image, and voice. Product pages are crafted with the Astro web framework, perfect for content-driven sites. The mission was to generate cutting-edge baby products using various prompts, with AI generating filenames and frontmatters. The radio ad, a result of the text and image outputs, is then tailored into compelling content through a radio prompt.
### Models used

#### Anthropic (Claude Sonnet)
We leveraged Anthropic's complimentary credits to utilize the Claude Sonnet model, which offers an excellent blend of performance and speed. Anthropic is instrumental in creating prompts for our Stable Diffusion model to generate images. Additionally, we employ Anthropic to generate product descriptions and radio scripts.

**Example prompt**
> The products should be futuristic and environmently friendly",
Invent a new innovative baby product",

#### Stable Diffusion
This model was used for generating an image by an ai generated prompt of anthropic. We used the `@fal-ai/serverless-client` package.

**Example prompt**
> You are an expert prompt engineer for Stable Diffusion.
  Your task is to write a prompt for the product you just invented

**Code Example**
```typescript  
export async function generateImage(prompt: string, fileName: string) {
  const result = (await fal.subscribe("fal-ai/fast-sdxl", {
    input: {
      prompt,
    },
    logs: true,
  })) as { images: { url: string }[] };
}
```


#### Eleven Labs
ElevenLabs offers us the opportunity to choose a suiting voice which was generating an radio ad for our products.

**Example prompt**
> Respond only with a text to be read by the radio presentor, dont add any comments or cues.

**Code Example**
```typescript  
export async function generateVoice(text: string, fileName: string) {
  const audioStream = await elevenlabs.generate({
    stream: true,
    voice: "5x4OabTaxKEADQiUryOC",
    text,
    model_id: "eleven_multilingual_v2",
  });
}
```
